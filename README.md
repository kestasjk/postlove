Post Love for phpBB 3.2, when installed on webDiplomacy.net
==========

Description:

    Add +1 to people's posts.
	Targeted at those using webDip with phpBB3; see the original extension if installing on a vanilla phpBB3 version (this version will still work, but the tweaks have no point on a vanilla install)
